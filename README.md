# Introduction to Machine Learning for Natural Language with Python
Code from Intro to Machine Learning for Natural Language with Python workshop, given on August 15, 2021 as part of ProjectCSGIRLS.
## Usage
This repository contains 4 files: `intropython.py` (an introduction to Python), `badhatespeechdetector.py` (an introduction to machine learning for NLP via a hate speech detector with bad data balancing), `goodhatespeechdetector.py` (the same hate speech detector but with better data balancing), and `formspring_data.csv` (the training data for both hate speech detectors).
To run them, run the following (one at a time):
```
python3 intropython.py
```
```
python3 badhatespeechdetector.py
```
```
python3 goodhatespeechdetector.py
```
